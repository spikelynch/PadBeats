## TODO

Make the sequencer be able to trigger functions - which can play synths, set levels on synths, do anything - these should return the 'main' synth if it needs to be released (and return nil if there's no follow-up needed).

Do this in a way which allows parameters to be captured when the notes are recorded, or when they are played - both are useful
